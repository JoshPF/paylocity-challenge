## How to Run
Open `frontend/index.html` in your browser.

For the backend, run `docker-compose up -d --build`. For help on installing Docker and Docker
Compose, go to https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

NOTE: Containers may take a while to come up, so communication to the backend may be delayed.
